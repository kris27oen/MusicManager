## Chatbot Jukebox – Manage Your Music Playback

### 🎤 Song Request Interaction  
Type a song request like *"play Taylor Swift"* or *"I want to hear 周杰倫"*  
→ Chatbot will return 3–5 matching song buttons labeled like:  
🎵 Add: *Blank Space - Taylor Swift*

Click on a song button → Chatbot replies:  
✅ Queued: *[song name] - [artist]*  
(Only if Spotify Premium is active and a playback device is available)

---

### 🔐 Premium User Check  
- If logged in with a **non-Premium** Spotify account, typing a song request will return:  
  ⚠️ *Only Spotify Premium users can queue songs or control playback.*

- If **not logged in**, chatbot responds:  
  ⚠️ *Please log in to Spotify first to queue a song.*

### 💬 Regular Chat Support (Gemini)  
Input general questions like *"What’s a good chill playlist?"* or *"Analyze my playlist theme"*  
→ Gemini responds intelligently without triggering song search.

## 🎛️ Playback Tab – Control Your Music Effortlessly

✅ **Playback Controls**  
Type ▶️ "Play Music" or "Reseume", ⏸️ "Pause", ⏭️ "Next" or "Skip" on the chatbot to control your Spotify player (Premium + active device) with feedback.
Playback controls provide feedback like *"Playback started"*.

### 📋 Now Playing Status  
Click 📋 Now Playing  
→ Displays:  
🎵 *Now playing: [song name] - [artist]*  
(or warning if nothing is playing)

### 📜 Queue Visualization  
At the bottom, see **Upcoming Tracks in Queue**:  
Display up to 5 queued songs as:  
1. *[song name] - [artist]*

If queue is empty, show:  
*"Queue is empty or not available."*

### 🔐 Premium Protection  
If you are not Premium, a warning appears at the top:
