## Problem you might encounter during Spotify Authorization Process (Login)

1. When you first open streamlit, you have to always place in your Spotify Client ID, Spotify Client Secret, Gemini API Key.
2. Click Login and it will redirect you for authorization.
3. After authorization, you will have to insert your APIs configuration once more as it refresh your API on every authorization.
4. Click login again, but return from teh authorization page, you should be able to see your playlist by then.
5. Remember to open your spotify and play the current song to open the jukebox. Also, turn your playlist to public so that the chatbot can see it.
6. Enjoy !!!
